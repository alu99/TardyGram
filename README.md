A dot matrix printing Twitter bot

TardyGram is a Twitter bot project I worked on throughout the summer after my sophomore year of high school. There are 3 components to TardyGram:
	
	1: A twitter account (@tardygram)
	2: A Raspberry Pi mini computer
	3: A dot matrix printer, which is an antiquated printer that prints by dotting the paper with red and black dots. (I don't remember the exact model, but I think it was an Epson)
	4: A webcam mounted over the dot matrix printer
	
How TardyGram works:

	1. Tweet an image and mention @tardygram
	2. TardyGram will print out your picture using a dot matrix printer
	3. The webcam will take a picture of the print out
	4. TardyGram will reply to your tweet with a picture of the dot matrixed version of your picture!
	
At it's peak, TardyGram was receiving tens of mentions everyday and was even mentioned by Hackaday. Unfortunately, TardyGram is no longer running but you can still view it's tweet history on Twitter. Warning: a few Tweets may be NSFW. After all, we can't control what random users send us on the internet.
